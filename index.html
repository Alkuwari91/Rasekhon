    <section id="unit1">
        <h2>Unit 1: Introduction to Machine Learning (ML)</h2>
        <p>Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. This unit covers the basic concepts of ML, including supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, and introduces key algorithms like decision trees and support vector machines.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="unit2">
        <h2>Unit 2: Exploratory Data Analysis</h2>
        <p>This unit focuses on techniques for understanding data before applying machine learning models. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) involves summarizing data sets, detecting patterns, and using visualization tools to gain insights. You will learn about libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib in Python to assist with EDA.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="unit3">
        <h2>Unit 3: Correlation and Regression</h2>
        <p>In this unit, you will learn about correlation and how it is used to measure the relationship between two variables. Additionally, regression techniques, such as linear and logistic regression, are covered, focusing on how to model and predict outcomes based on input data.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="unit4">
        <h2>Unit 4: Linear Regression with Scikit-Learn</h2>
        <p>This unit teaches you how to implement linear regression using Scikit-Learn, a popular machine learning library in Python. You will explore how to prepare data, fit a model, and evaluate its performance with metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE).</p>
    </section>

    <section id="unit5">
        <h2>Unit 5: Clustering</h2>
        <p>Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique used to group similar data points together. In this unit, you will learn about clustering algorithms like K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering and how they can be applied to segment data without predefined labels.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="unit6">
        <h2>Unit 6: Clustering with Python</h2>
        <p>This unit provides hands-on experience with implementing clustering algorithms using Python. You will explore real-world datasets and use libraries like Scikit-Learn to apply clustering techniques, evaluate cluster quality, and visualize clusters.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="unit7">
        <h2>Unit 7: Introduction to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)</h2>
        <p>This unit introduces Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), which are modeled after the human brain. You will learn about the structure of ANNs, including neurons, layers, and activation functions, and explore the concepts of forward and backward propagation.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="unit8">
        <h2>Unit 8: Training an Artificial Neural Network</h2>
        <p>In this unit, you will gain practical experience training neural networks using Python libraries such as TensorFlow and Keras. Topics include choosing the right optimizer, handling overfitting, and improving model accuracy with techniques like dropout.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="unit9">
        <h2>Unit 9: Introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)</h2>
        <p>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are specialized for processing grid-like data, such as images. This unit will explain the layers of CNNs, including convolutional and pooling layers, and how CNNs are used for tasks like image classification and object detection.</p>
